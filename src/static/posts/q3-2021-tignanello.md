This quarter, we’re highlighting one of the world’s most fiercely loved and celebrated wines: Tignanello.

The estate is owned by the Antinori family – wine royalty, and one of the oldest businesses in the world. They first started making wine in 1385, and also count Solaia as one of their labels.

Tignanello itself was first produced in 1970, in the rolling hills of Tuscany. It has since come to represent a seminal moment in Italian wine history – a marked break from the vinous traditions of the region.

What the Antinoris did with this special wine was blend the indigenous Sangiovese – the darling grape behind Chianti, Chianti Classico, and Brunello di Montalcino – with the might of Bordeaux’s varietals, namely Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.

The results were spectacular (if a little controversial). Marrying the mouth-watering acidity and rich cherry and plum notes of the Sangiovese, with the complexity, structure, and black berry fruits of the Cabernets, Tignanello swiftly became a cult favourite.

The reason for its controversy was that it defied the regulations of Chianti. It went against the age-old formula of winemaking in the region. European law is notoriously strict when it comes to which grapes can be grown where, and Tignanello had cast itself outside the recognisable labelling terms.

Fortunately, a couple of years earlier in 1968, Sassicaia had experimented with a pure Bordeaux blend and found itself similarly ostracised.

A new term was therefore born, one designed to distinguish these astonishing new wines from the table plonk that also didn’t qualify as Chianti. That term was ‘Super Tuscan’.

Masseto, Ornellaia, and Tignanello’s later-established brother, Solaia, also joined the ranks of this swelling and irresistible new force in winemaking. Since those heady days, their quality has continued to improve. Nowadays, Super Tuscans rub shoulders with the finest wines of Bordeaux.

Whereas in varietal terms, most of these wines are direct replicas of their French counterparts however, Tignanello retains its Italian roots by dint of its high percentage of Sangiovese. It boasts huge production – some 25,000 cases each year – which means that its prices are that much more reasonable. Antonio Galloni, a leading wine critic describes Tignanello as “the single greatest high-quality, estate wine made in scale”.
